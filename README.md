# Applying_Machine_Learning_for_Customer_Analysis_and_Segmentation

With an ever-increasing number of businesses in every sector, the competition is higher than ever before. Businesses all around need to go the extra mile to ensure sustainability
and growth. For the right group of customers who have demand for their products/services as well as the group who can be persuaded to create a demand for that, i used machine learning techniques, and customer segmentation through data mining. To enhance a business, it is now necessary to know about the customers minutely. In this Project of customer segmentation of a retail company, K-means,
An unsupervised machine-learning algorithm has been used for clustering its customers into clusters which is used to design ads and campaigns for increasing sales and revenue.

The data set I collected from Kaggle consists of data of 2240 unique customers and
29 columns representing information such as customer ID, birth year, education, marital status, income, spent amount on different products in the last two years, promotions availed, etc. 

Firstly, a correlation matrix was formed from the significant features of the dataset. The features considered significant from the business perspective and the outcome of the matrix was combined to finalize which features to include in feature-pairing for K-means clustering.
To achieve Customer Segmentation I follow this six-step data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, choosing cluster numbers, K-means clustering, and result analysis. Later, PCA was performed to reduce the dimension of the dataset to perform clustering on the whole dataset with K-means.
